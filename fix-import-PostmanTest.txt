To fix the import error in src/components/test/PostmanTest.tsx, replace the import line:

import { AspectConfig, AspectMeaning, HouseMeaning, PlanetMeaning } from "../../types/astrology/chartDisplay";

with:

import { AspectConfig, HouseMeaning, PlanetMeaning } from "../../types/astrology/chartDisplay";

Note: AspectMeaning is not exported from the types file and should be removed from the import.

Please apply this change manually in the file src/components/test/PostmanTest.tsx.
